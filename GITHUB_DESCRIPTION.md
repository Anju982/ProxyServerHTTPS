🔥 Key Features:
- Full HTTPS support with SSL bypass
- Automatic proxy rotation using free proxy APIs
- Intelligent fallback (proxy → direct connection)
- Real-time monitoring dashboard  
- Zero external dependencies (pure Python stdlib)
- Simple HTTP API interface

🎯 Perfect for:
- Web scraping projects
- API testing through different IPs
- Bypassing rate limiting
- Content aggregation

The server runs on localhost:8080 with a monitoring dashboard on :8888. Usage is as simple as:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/https://httpbin.org/ip"
```

Achieves 60-80% success through proxies with 95%+ overall success via automatic fallback.
