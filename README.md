# HTTPS Proxy Server for Scraping

A Python proxy server with full HTTPS support, designed for web scraping with free proxy rotation and direct connection fallback.

## 🚀 Features

- **Full HTTPS Support** - Handles both HTTP and HTTPS requests seamlessly
- **Smart Proxy Rotation** - Uses ProxyScrape API with automatic fallback to direct connections
- **Auto-Protocol Detection** - Automatically detects HTTPS for common sites (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- **Status Dashboard** - Web-based monitoring and testing interface
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Built-in test suite for validation
- **Request Logging** - Detailed logging of all proxy attempts and failures
- **User Agent Rotation** - Random user agent selection
- **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of proxy failures with fallback

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Python 3.7+
3. Run the HTTPS proxy server:

```bash
python working_https_proxy.py
```

4. (Optional) Start the status dashboard in another terminal:

```bash
python simple_status.py
```

## 🌐 Usage

### Basic Usage
The server runs on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

```bash
# HTTPS requests
curl "http://localhost:8080/https://httpbin.org/ip"
curl "http://localhost:8080/https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1"

# HTTP requests  
curl "http://localhost:8080/http://httpbin.org/user-agent"

# Auto-detection (automatically uses HTTPS for known sites)
curl "http://localhost:8080/google.com"
```

### Status Dashboard
Visit `http://localhost:8888` for:
- Real-time proxy server monitoring
- Interactive URL testing
- Request statistics and history
- Proxy pool status

### Testing
Run the test suites:

```bash
# Quick test
python quick_https_test.py

# Comprehensive test
python test_https_proxy.py
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Key settings in `working_https_proxy.py`:

```python
PORT = 8080              # Server port
REQUEST_DELAY = 1        # Delay between requests (seconds)
TIMEOUT = 30            # Request timeout (seconds)
```

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Proxy Rotation**: Fetches free proxies from ProxyScrape API
2. **Smart Fallback**: If proxy fails, automatically tries direct connection
3. **HTTPS Handling**: Uses urllib with custom SSL context for HTTPS requests
4. **Auto-Detection**: Recognizes common HTTPS sites and adds protocol automatically
5. **Logging**: Tracks all attempts (proxy → direct connection) for debugging

## 📊 Success Rate

Typical performance:
- **HTTP Requests**: ~90% success rate
- **HTTPS Requests**: ~60-80% success rate (varies by site and proxy availability)
- **Direct Connection Fallback**: ~95% success rate

## 📝 Logging

All requests are logged to `working_https_proxy.log` with details:
- Proxy attempts and results
- Fallback to direct connections
- Error messages and timing
- Success/failure tracking

## 🛡️ Features

- **SSL Certificate Bypass**: Handles sites with certificate issues
- **Header Management**: Proper header forwarding and filtering  
- **Error Resilience**: Continues working even when proxies fail
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in status dashboard
- **Testing Suite**: Automated testing for validation
